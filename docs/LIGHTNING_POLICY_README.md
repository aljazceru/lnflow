# Lightning Policy Manager - Next-Generation charge-lnd

A modern, intelligent fee management system that combines the flexibility of charge-lnd with advanced inbound fee strategies, machine learning, and automatic safety mechanisms.

## 🚀 Key Improvements Over charge-lnd

### 1. **Advanced Inbound Fee Strategies**
- **charge-lnd**: Basic inbound fee support (mostly negative discounts)
- **Our improvement**: Intelligent inbound fee calculation based on:
  - Liquidity balance state
  - Flow patterns and direction
  - Competitive landscape
  - Revenue optimization goals

```ini
[balance-optimization]
strategy = balance_based
fee_ppm = 1000
# Automatically calculated based on channel state:
# High local balance → inbound discount to encourage inbound flow
# Low local balance → inbound premium to preserve liquidity
```

### 2. **Automatic Performance Tracking & Rollbacks**
- **charge-lnd**: Static policies with no performance monitoring
- **Our improvement**: Continuous performance tracking with automatic rollbacks

```ini
[revenue-channels]
strategy = revenue_max
enable_auto_rollback = true
rollback_threshold = 0.25  # Rollback if revenue drops >25%
learning_enabled = true    # Learn from results
```

### 3. **Data-Driven Revenue Optimization**
- **charge-lnd**: Rule-based fee setting
- **Our improvement**: Machine learning from historical performance

```ini
[smart-optimization]
strategy = revenue_max  # Uses historical data to find optimal fees
learning_enabled = true  # Continuously learns and improves
```

### 4. **Enhanced Safety Mechanisms**
- **charge-lnd**: Basic fee limits
- **Our improvement**: Comprehensive safety systems
  - Automatic rollbacks on revenue decline
  - Fee change limits and validation
  - Performance monitoring and alerting
  - SQLite database for audit trails

### 5. **Advanced Matching Criteria**
- **charge-lnd**: Basic channel/node matching
- **Our improvement**: Rich matching capabilities

```ini
[competitive-channels]
# New matching criteria not available in charge-lnd
network.min_alternatives = 5      # Channels with many alternative routes
peer.fee_ratio.min = 0.5          # Based on competitive positioning
activity.level = high, medium     # Based on flow analysis
flow.7d.min = 1000000            # Based on recent activity
```

### 6. **Real-time Monitoring & Management**
- **charge-lnd**: Run-once tool with cron
- **Our improvement**: Built-in daemon mode with monitoring

```bash
# Daemon mode with automatic rollbacks
./lightning_policy.py daemon --watch --interval 10
```

## 🔄 Migration from charge-lnd

### Step 1: Convert Configuration
Most charge-lnd configurations work with minimal changes:

**charge-lnd config:**
```ini
[high-capacity]
chan.min_capacity = 5000000
strategy = static
fee_ppm = 1500
```

**Our config (compatible):**
```ini
[high-capacity]
chan.min_capacity = 5000000
strategy = static
fee_ppm = 1500
inbound_fee_ppm = -25  # Add inbound fee optimization
```

### Step 2: Enable Advanced Features
```ini
[high-capacity]
chan.min_capacity = 5000000
strategy = revenue_max        # Upgrade to data-driven optimization
fee_ppm = 1500               # Base fee (will be optimized)
inbound_fee_ppm = -25
learning_enabled = true      # Enable machine learning
enable_auto_rollback = true  # Add safety mechanism
rollback_threshold = 0.25    # Rollback if revenue drops >25%
```

### Step 3: Test and Deploy
```bash
# Test with dry-run
./lightning_policy.py -c migrated_config.conf apply --dry-run

# Deploy with monitoring
./lightning_policy.py -c migrated_config.conf daemon --watch
```

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Status
```bash
./lightning_policy.py -c config.conf status
```

### Detailed Reporting
```bash
./lightning_policy.py -c config.conf report --format json --output performance.json
```

### Rollback Protection
```bash
# Check rollback candidates
./lightning_policy.py -c config.conf rollback

# Execute rollbacks
./lightning_policy.py -c config.conf rollback --execute --macaroon-path ~/.lnd/admin.macaroon
```

## 🎯 Inbound Fee Strategies

### Liquidity-Based Discounts
```ini
[liquidity-management]
strategy = balance_based
# Automatically calculates inbound fees based on balance:
# - High local balance (>80%): Large inbound discount (-100 ppm)
# - Medium balance (40-80%): Moderate discount (-25 ppm)
# - Low balance (<20%): Small discount or premium (+25 ppm)
```

### Flow-Based Inbound Fees
```ini
[flow-optimization]
strategy = flow_based
# Calculates inbound fees based on flow patterns:
# - Too much inbound flow: Charge inbound premium
# - Too little inbound flow: Offer inbound discount
# - Balanced flow: Neutral inbound fee
```

### Competitive Inbound Pricing
```ini
[competitive-strategy]
strategy = inbound_discount
network.min_alternatives = 5
# Offers inbound discounts when competing with many alternatives
# Automatically adjusts based on peer fee rates
```

## ⚠️ Safety Features

### Automatic Rollbacks
- Monitors revenue performance after fee changes
- Automatically reverts fees if performance degrades
- Configurable thresholds per policy
- Audit trail in SQLite database

### Fee Validation
- Ensures inbound fees don't make total routing fee negative
- Validates fee limits and ranges
- Prevents excessive fee changes

### Performance Tracking
- SQLite database stores all changes and performance data
- Historical analysis for optimization
- Policy performance reporting

## 🔮 Advanced Use Cases

### 1. Rebalancing Automation
```ini
[rebalancing-helper]
chan.min_ratio = 0.85
strategy = balance_based
fee_ppm = 100              # Very low outbound fee
inbound_fee_ppm = -150     # Large inbound discount
# Encourages inbound flow to rebalance channels
```

### 2. Premium Peer Management
```ini
[premium-peers]
node.id = 033d8656219478701227199cbd6f670335c8d408a92ae88b962c49d4dc0e83e025
strategy = static
fee_ppm = 500              # Lower fees for premium peers
inbound_fee_ppm = -25      # Small inbound discount
enable_auto_rollback = false # Don't rollback premium peer rates
```

### 3. Channel Lifecycle Management
```ini
[new-channels]
chan.max_age_days = 30
strategy = static
fee_ppm = 200              # Low fees to establish flow
inbound_fee_ppm = -100     # Aggressive inbound discount

[mature-channels]
chan.min_age_days = 90
activity.level = high
strategy = revenue_max     # Optimize mature, active channels
learning_enabled = true
```
