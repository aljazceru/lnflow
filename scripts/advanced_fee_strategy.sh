# Lightning Fee Optimizer - Advanced Strategy with Inbound Fees
# 
# This script includes both outbound and inbound fee optimization to:
# 1. Prevent outbound drains
# 2. Encourage proper liquidity distribution  
# 3. Maximize routing revenue
# 4. Signal liquidity scarcity effectively
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - LND with inbound fee support
# - Add to lnd.conf: accept-positive-inbound-fees=true (for positive inbound fees)
#
# WARNING: This will modify both outbound AND inbound channel fees!

echo ""
echo "DRAIN PROTECTION: Positive inbound fees (50-150 ppm)"
echo "   • Discourages peers from pushing all their funds through you"
echo "   • Compensates you for the liquidity service"
echo "   • Protects your most valuable routing channels"
echo ""
echo "💧 LIQUIDITY ATTRACTION: Negative inbound fees (-15 to -50 ppm)"  
echo "   • Provides discounts to encourage inbound payments"
echo "   • Helps rebalance channels with too much local liquidity"
echo "   • Backwards compatible (older nodes see it as regular discount)"
echo ""
echo "BALANCED OPTIMIZATION: Small positive inbound fees (5-25 ppm)"
echo "   • Fine-tunes flow on high-performing channels"
echo "   • Prevents over-utilization in one direction"
echo "   • Maximizes total fee income"
echo ""
echo "FLOW OPTIMIZATION: Mixed strategy based on current balance"
echo "   • Asymmetric fees to encourage bidirectional flow" 
echo "   • Dynamic based on current liquidity distribution"
echo ""
echo "ACTIVATION: Aggressive negative inbound fees (-30 to -50 ppm)"
echo "   • Last resort for dormant channels"
echo "   • Makes your channels very attractive for routing"
echo "   • Higher risk but potential for activation"

echo ""
echo "• Drain Protection: Save ~5,000-10,000 sats/month from prevented drains"

echo "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES"
echo "════════════════════════════"
echo ""
echo "1. COMPATIBILITY: Inbound fees require updated nodes"
echo "2. TESTING: Start with small inbound fees and monitor routing success"  
echo "3. MONITORING: Watch for routing failures - some older nodes may struggle"
echo "4. GRADUAL: Apply inbound fee strategy gradually over 2-3 weeks"
